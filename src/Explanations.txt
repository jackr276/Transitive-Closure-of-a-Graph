Explanations File


This program takes in user input about the reachability of a graph and will return the transitive closure of
the graph.

Instructions:

Download and unzip the file into the directory of your choice. "cd" into that directoy and use one of these two options:

Option 1: Using clang++(preferrred option):
	clang++ Jack_Robbins_jmr226_3.cpp -o run
	./run

Option 2: Using clang:
	clang -lstdc++ Jack_Robbins_jmr226_3.cpp -o run
	./run
